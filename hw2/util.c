This code contains several different functions and is used for different purposes. 
At the beginning of the code, the libraries "stdio.h" and "math.h" are included and another library called "util.h" is called.
These libraries contain standard input/output functions, math operations, and other auxiliary functions necessary for the program to run.
The code is named according to the purposes of the variables. Functions take parameters and act accordingly. 
Operations in the code are managed using if/else statements and switch/case statements. 
The code also includes some checks for errors.
